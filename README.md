# Description
This repository is a collection of questions of three difficulties - easy, medium and hard. The questions were generated by ChatGPT and cover the concepts of sub querying and joins.

# Comments
While I have used a basic prompt to get ChatGPT generate 48 questions based on three difficulties. However, the medium difficulty is really not medium rather easy. And hard level questions are of medium level. I have also attached a pdf with the SQL questions. 

# Conclusion

I would say this is a subpar list of questions to practice SQL for an intermediate but a great start for a beginner or amateur. I am looking for more databases to work on my SQL skills and if. you know any resources, do let me know. Thanks!
